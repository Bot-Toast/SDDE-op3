Code Host for assignment: 

Here is the Code for my (s***594) assignment.

It also documents all the changes :

See Dev for main logic progression.

See Dev_gui for user interface progression

and See integration for the joining of the two.

Apologies if there are any rude Variable names, I haven't gone back over them so I can't remmeber.


I used a third party library for this project : OpenFX (JavaFX)

SDK will be included in .Zip.

Also don't forget to add these JVM options.

on Intellij -> goto Run then edit configurations, select blue drop down 'modify options' and add VM options. 
Paste the below into that and apply.

--module-path "C:\Java\javafx-sdk-15.0.1\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml

otherwise it may not run.


Thanks,
Bot-Toast. (s***594)
